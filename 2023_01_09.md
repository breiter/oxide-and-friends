  All good GPT AI systems are expensive enough that their frivolous use declines significantly.
  It's still used significantly in Academic Misconduct, because it's cheaper than the alternatives.
</td>
<td>
  A new trend, called something stupid like Web3, or Web4, emerges. Probably to do with AI
  or the "Metaverse". Some people make a lot of money, but time proves it is also a fad.
</td>
<td>
  A large/prestigious university starts teaching CS1 in Rust. Time reveals it is a mistake.

Passkeys will be widely available for authentication but have very little traction because of various complexities like the need to create multiple certificates or export them across ecosystems. There will be a high-profile horror stories about losing access to accounts because Passkeys are too secure and also stories about passkey-protected accounts being hijacked anyway through an alternative authentication mechanism. Everyone loses faith and throws up their hands. Google, Microsoft, and Apple are successful with their proprietary push-authenticator app for their services. The rest of the world sticks with passwords, totp, oauth, and saml.

<td>
Microsoft will have replaced the legacy Office suite with Electron versions based on the Sharepoint Online code (similar to the current Electron Outlook replacing the legacy Outlook) which will run on Windows, macOS, and Linux. Microsoft announces the end of life plans for the legacy Visual Studio and msc tool chain to focus on VS Code with LLVM/clang, dotnet, rust, java, python, nodejs/typescript as the tentpole toolchains.

<td>
The mainstream desktop operating system from Microsoft will hvae become something resembling ChromeOS but based on Edge and bundles Electron-style Office apps and a VDI client tied to Azure capable of streaming legacy win32 apps -- but is still called Windows. "Windows Azure Cloud Desktop" or something. Windows Classic (NT) as we currently know it is primarily sold by Microsoft as a web service in Azure Desktop to run legacy enterprise apps. Microsoft will no longer sell you Exchange or other Office servers for on-prem. You must run the Azure service. Microsoft has announced that in future only special Enterprise SKUs of Windows client will be available to run on-prem and only in a VM. A bespoke Crostini-style Linux environment -- possibly still Subsystem for Linux -- is available but not the "happy path".
